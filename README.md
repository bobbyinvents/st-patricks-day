# st-patricks-day
Tests your luck by generating random text for two minutes until it matches the Zen of Python.

This project idea was from BeginnerPy:
> March 9th: :four_leaf_clover: St. Patricks Day :four_leaf_clover: is next week! Create something to determine if someone has the luck of the Irish.
